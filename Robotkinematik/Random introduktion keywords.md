### Kinematic chain
a kinematic chain is a frame (coordinate system) described inside each other. Like a main frame having a frame and then another frame inside the original frame. basically everything is relative to each other.

### Special Frames 
###### Base Frame:
the base frame is the frame the base is connected to.

###### End-effector frame:
this is the frame at the end of the robot.



### Rigid body frame 
the rigid body frame are all the frames together
